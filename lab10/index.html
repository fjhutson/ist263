        I am a junior at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Public Relations. In order to branch out into the PR field, I currently hold a position as the VP of Administration for Syracuse's PRSSA chapter, and serve as an associate for Hill Communications, a student-run PR firm. Beyond PR, I am interested in all things tech, pop culture, and fashion! When I have free time, you will most definitely find me at the beach with friends and family. You also may find me writing in my journal, for my blog, or for one of the various student magazines I'm affiliated with.
